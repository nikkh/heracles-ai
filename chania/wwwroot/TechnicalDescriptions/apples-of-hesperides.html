<p>This labour invokes iraklion/hesperides and also increments a custom metric (apples-of-hesperidesTransactions). It also creates a compond metric called HesperidesCount and within that will track succes and failures within two lower level metrics HesperidesSuccess and HesperidesFailure.  If the current second is even HesperidesCount will report success, otherwise it will report failure.</p>
