<p>This labour invokes iraklion/cerberus and also increments a custom metric (cerberusTransactions). Dependent on a querystring parameter called cpumax=true, cerberus will also attemot to find the 100000th Prime number.  Otherwise it does nothing. This can be useful for forcing CPU usage to be seen in metrics.</p>
