<p>This labour invokes iraklion/stymphalian and also increments a custom metric (stymphalian-birdsTransactions). It places a message on a service bus queue which is then processed by the Patra Azure Function.  Patra has its own dedicated application insights instance - which mean you can test correlation in application map across unrelated instances and behind queues.</p>
