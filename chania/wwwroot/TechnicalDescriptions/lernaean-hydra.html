<p>This labour invokes iraklion/lernaean and also increments a custom metric (lernaean-hydraTransactions).  It checks if the current time is between 16:00 and 16:30 and if it is, will eturn an exception inidcating that the service is unavailable.  Otherwise it calculates a delay of x, then sleeps the thread for x milliseconds before returning "Hello from Lernaean Hydra".</p>
