<p>This labour involes thessaloniki/diomedes which also increments a custom metric (mares-of-diomedes-bullTransactions).  This labour is very labour intensive.  It creates the database tables if they dont already exist, populates them, then reads from them (allowing you to examine SQL traces) and then runs a provate method called DoArtificalWork.  See the source code for full details, but this does different things according to random facotrs and enables you to test the perfromance analysis and perfromance tracing capabiliites of Application Insights.  Finally, for good measure it also writes a blob to blob storage.</p>
