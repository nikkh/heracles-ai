<p>This labour invokes iraklion/cretan and also increments a custom metric (cretan-bullTransactions). It places a message on a service bus queue which is then processed by the Ioannina Azure Function.  Ioannina uses the iraklion application insights instance - which mean you can test correlation in application map across the same instance but behind a queue.</p>
