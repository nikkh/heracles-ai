# Metrics

Two types of metrics are available to the users of Application Insights:
 - Log-based metrics
 - Standard metrics

Each type brings a unique value in monitoring application health, diagnostics and analytics. The developers who are instrumenting applications can decide which type of metric is best suited to a particular scenario, depending on the size of the application, expected volume of telemetry, and business requirements for metrics precision and alerting.
