# Application Map

Application Map helps you spot performance bottlenecks or failure hotspots across all components of your distributed application. Each node on the map represents an application component or its dependencies; and has health KPI and alerts status. You can click through from any component to more detailed diagnostics, such as Application Insights events. If your app uses Azure services, you can also click through to Azure diagnostics, such as SQL Database Advisor recommendations. [See the introduction to Application Map](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-map?tabs=net) or watch a demo below.
